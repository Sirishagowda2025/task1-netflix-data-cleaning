Data cleaning and preprocessing of Netflix dataset as part of internship task.

# 📊 Netflix Data Cleaning & Preprocessing — Internship Task 1

Welcome! This repository contains my work for **Task 1** of the internship program, where I cleaned, explored, and structured a raw Netflix dataset using Python, AI tools, and self-guided research.

## 🧠 Objective

To clean and preprocess a raw dataset of Netflix titles to prepare it for future data analysis and machine learning applications. This task helped me strengthen my skills in data wrangling, AI-assisted development, and independent problem-solving.
