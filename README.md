Data cleaning and preprocessing of Netflix dataset as part of internship task.

# 📊 Netflix Data Cleaning & Preprocessing — Internship Task 1

Welcome! This repository contains my work for **Task 1** of the internship program, where I cleaned, explored, and structured a raw Netflix dataset using Python, AI tools, and self-guided research.

## 🎯 Objective

- Handled missing and duplicate values
- Converted date columns to correct formats
- Cleaned `duration`, `country`, and `listed_in` columns
- Created a cleaned `.csv` dataset from the original
- Used AI tools to debug and enhance my understanding
